  "description" : "The stock TurboGrafx-16 is RF only, but the TurboBooster, CD, and Duo support composite output.  The shader is setup similarly to the SFC, however in reality there is a distinct difference: the SNES generates RGB first and uses a conventional RGB to YPbPr to composite chip.  The PC Engine uses a proprietary chip that outputs RGB and Y/C directly (Pb and Pr are already modulated).  The composite signal is obtained with a discrete analog combiner. Therefore we have appropriated the sys-component shader to represent the Y/C DAC and bypass sys-rgb entirely.  The PC Engine RGB to YPbPr LUT is not applied here.  Use an emulator that outputs the correct colors for composite video.",
